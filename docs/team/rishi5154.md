 ## Project: TAsker

 TAsker is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

 Written below are my contributions to the project.
     
 - **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=totalCommits&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Rishi5154&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

 - **Enhancements implemented**:
 
     - **Implement the student model**: Update existing Person model to match actual needs of student
     
        - What it does: 
          Includes student specific fields such as their matriculation number, telegram.
     
        - Justification: 
          The given Person model simply lacked the precise fields necessary for basic student administration.
     
        - Highlights:
          Update edit operation in order to edit the student objects, with all new fields added.
     
      - **Unattend command**: Appended a command that enables for the unmarking of student's attendance.
      
      - **Archive command**: A command that copies the current data of TAsker at `/data`.
      
      - **Consultation management**:
          
         - Set-up backend functionality from scratch to display on UI, with **conceptualisation** & **implementation** of Consultation model
         - **Add Consult command**: A command that enables for the addition of a consultation.
         - **List Consult command**: A command that allows user to list all consultations.
      
      - **Unit tests**: Inserted JUnit tests for all active commands & updated existing tests accordingly. 
 
 - **Contributions to documentation**: Updated UG for `unattend`, `archive`, `add-consult` & `list-consult` operations with examples.
 
 - **Contributions to DG**: Updated DG for `list` & `find` student operations, with UML diagrams for each command.
 
 - **Project management**:
