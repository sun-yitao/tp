TAsker is a **desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage student administration, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAsker can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAsker.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - **`list`** : Lists all student.

   - **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com t/johndoe m/A0123456B tg/friends` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   - **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tg/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tg/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tg/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tg/friend`, `tg/friend tg/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
- Any invalid parameter tags will be parsed as literals.<br>
  e.g. If we pass the `n/a/James` in as a parameter, 
  since `a/` is an invalid parameter tag,
  it will attempt to interpret `a/James` as a `NAME`,
  rather than treating `a/` as a parameter tag and `James` as its field.
  
- Extra inputs to commands will be ignored. <br>
  e.g. 

  - `list 1`, `1` will be ignored, 

  - `exit abc`, `abc` will be ignored.

</div>

- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- Existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the student will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Locating students by name: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Only the name is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

e.g. running this command will create a file called `tasker_2020-09-13_1041` containing all your saved data, in your `/data` folder.

Format: `archive`

### Exporting attendance : `exportatt`

Exports attendance to a csv file in `data/attendance_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.csv`
